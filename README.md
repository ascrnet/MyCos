# MyCos

![MyCos](https://github.com/ascrnet/mycos/blob/main/src/mycos.png)

A small cassette operating system with the essentials I think you should have to use this classic device.
It was intended for the XL/XE series, some basic functions necessary for novices to use the cassette.

* A. Back to Basic when active to use this included language.
* B. Activate or deactivate the cassette engine, necessary to listen to the tape and detect where the program is.
* C. Verify the load, this checks if your program in Basic, assambler or binary loads without problems from the same tape. 
* D. Load and run a binary program from tape, using the standard tscb loader from baktragh.
* E. Generate a copy of the MyCos in case you need it (similar to the H: option in DOS).
* F. Cold reboot your ATARI.
